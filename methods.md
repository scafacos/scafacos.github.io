## P<sup>2</sup>NFFT
The particle-particle NFFT (P<sup>2</sup>NFFT) is a general framework for particle mesh
algorithms based on nonequispaced fast Fourier transforms [NFFT](http://www.nfft.org).
By appropriate choice of parameters, this framework includes the Particle-Mesh Ewald methods
for periodic boundary conditions and the fast summation algorithm
for non-periodic boundary conditions.

The corresponding developer of this method is [Michael Pippig](./support.md/#mpip).
