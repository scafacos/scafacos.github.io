##Short description

ScaFaCoS is a library of scalable fast coulomb solvers.

This is a network project of [German research groups](./partners.html)
working on a unified parallel library for various methods to solve
electrostatic (and gravitational) problems in large particle
simulations. The main focus of the project is to provide efficiently
implemented methods for electrostatic problems in order to scale up to
thousands of processors.

You can freely [**download**](./download.html) the library. If
you use it in your research, please cite our [publication](./publications.html).
